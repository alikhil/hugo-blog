Hey!
Eventually, my desk got pretty messy with all the cables and other stuff piled up on it. Also, my cats started playing with and gnawing on wires. So, I decided to reorganize everything on my desk. Check it out!

<!---more--->

I've got a medium-sized table, about 120 by 80 cm. It's wide (deep) but not too long. I need to keep everything in order and clean so I can work comfortably.

Here's what my setup looked like before I made all the changes I mentioned.

As you can see, I've got a work laptop, a Mac mini, a monitor on its own stand, a journal, AirPods, and a few other things. I also bought a USB switch at some point because I got tired of plugging and unplugging my webcam manually in my [KVM-less setup](https://alikhil.dev/posts/how-to-use-3-computers-without-kvm/).

## Here's what I've done

* I mounted the monitor to the arm, which freed up space below the screen.
* I set up my Mac mini under the table.
* I've got my MacBook pro mounted under the table.
* I installed the USB hub into the monitor arm. It's a solid connection point, but the switch button on it is a bit uncomfortable to press. So,
* Put the extended switch button under the table, close to the chair.
* There's a mounted headphones holder under the table.
* The cables that ran next to each other were routed through the sleeves.
* Bind cables together with hook and loops tie

## List of things that I've used

* [The cable sleeve](https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ewdgm1c) is super handy for binding the cables together!
* [This cable sleeve](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvYuv3M) is a bit pricey, but it lets you pull cables out from the middle without damaging it.
* [MacBook under desk mount support](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyRlHBM). Antiscratch stickers came loose at the second day. So donâ€™t recommend this one.
